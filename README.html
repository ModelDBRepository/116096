   models of multiple spike interactions in spike-timing dependent
   plasticity.

How to run the model:
---------------------

Simply auto-launch the model from ModelDB or download and extract the
archive then under

MSWIN
-----

Run mknrndll, cd to the expanded directory and click on the make
nrnmech.dll button.  Under windows explorer double click on the
mosinit.hoc file

LINUX/UNIX
----------

Run nrnivmodl in the expanded archive folder.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the expanded folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation has started
-------------------------------

Select the button for the simulation that you would like to run.  For
example, selecting the Fig 2A button actually reproduces 2Aa, 2Ab, 2Ac
and 2Ad:
